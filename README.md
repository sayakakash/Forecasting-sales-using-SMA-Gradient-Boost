FORECASTING OF THE NEXT DEMAND:

ts is a time period component. And the monthly sales of mixer grinder from 2016 to 2019 is shown. I have 4 years of data. "ts" represents the time series index or time period component. It is a sequential numbering or labeling of the data points in the time series dataset. Each value of "ts" corresponds to a specific time point or period, in this case, represented as a combination of month and year.

There are two datasets 

sales.csv and prediction .csv

Simple moving average (SMA) is calculated in excel first and then on it models are used 
Forecasting of 2020 1st quarter is shown using gradient boost since linear regression performed badly during training.
